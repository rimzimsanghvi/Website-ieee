        <p><em>Navratri meaning 'nine nights', is one of the most popular and widely celebrated Hindu festivals
         in many parts of India. Gujarat, however, is the only state that erupts into a nine-night dance festival, 
         perhaps the longest in the world. Each night, all over the state, villages and cities alike, people gather
        in open spaces to celebrate feminine divinity, referred to as Shakti.</em></p><br><br>
        <p><em>The dance form known as ras garba (also joined sometimes by dandiya, which uses small wooden sticks), 
            comes from Lord Krishna's worship rather than Goddess worship, from the Gop culture of Saurashtra and
            Kutch. Stories of relationships between Krishna and the Gopis, and their emotions, also often make 
            their way into the ras garba music.</em></p><br><br>
        <p><em>Nevertheless, the focal point of every garba circle is the small Goddess shrine erected by each 
            community to mark the beginning of the festival, on the first day of the Hindu month of Ashwin.
             The shrine includes a garbo, an earthenware pot, in which a betel nut, coconut, and silver coin 
             are placed.</em></p><br><br>
        <p><em>Religious pilgrimage during this festival focuses mainly in the Shakti Peethas: Ambaji, Pavagadh and 
            Bahuchraji near Mehsana. There are also major celebrations in temples such as Ashapura Mata-no-Madh
             in Kutch, Khodiyar Mandir near Bhavnagar, and Chamunda Mata Mandir at Chotila on the Ahmedabad-Rajkot
              National Highway.</em></p>
